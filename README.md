## Hello World!

It's me, Clark, your friendly neighborhood developer :) I am a digital creative in Chicago, welcoming anyone interested to get in touch and enjoy some sushi with me!

My favorite sushi in the city is at [https://www.friendssushi.com](https://www.friendssushi.com), but I am open to meeting anywhere safe to nom on fish. My favorite roll is just the classic Tekka tuna roll, with a side of miso soup and edamame.

My favorite javascript is normally pretty basic and simple. I like playing with some of the new ES16 features such as classes and closures. I am a big fan of React and the Meteor web framework.

Always down for a roll! Shoot me a message @ [mail@clarknelson.com](mailto:mail@clarknelson.com)
